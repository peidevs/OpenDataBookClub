title: 2016 In Review
---

Happy New Year! Here are some links to various meetups, talks, and other online artifacts from 2016.

### January

* At the January [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-PEI/events/227801712/), Michael Easter spoke on [PDF Box](https://pdfbox.apache.org/).
* Also in January, [CBC Maritime Noon](http://www.cbc.ca/maritimenoon/2016/01/13/a-parking-warning-your-immigration-feedback-maritime-directions/) interviewed ODBC on the PEI Landmarks project. (This is a light-hearted interview about landmarks, not Open Data per se.)

### February

* At the February [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-PEI/events/228548487/), Robert Hughes, CAO with the Town of Stratford provided an overview of the services provided by the Town, and an initiative on Open Data and Open Government. 
* Also in February, [Michael Easter](http://twitter.com/30_for_60) spoke at a CIPS PEI Luncheon on 'Open Data and Generation Open'. Several ODBC members attended as well. Web-viewable presentation [here](http://peidevs.github.io/OpenDataBookClub/presentations/2016_FEB_18_CIPS_PEI) and PDF [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/og83kzxl1z08v55/2016_FEB_18_CIPS_PEI.pdf?dl=0) 

### March

* PEI Devs and ODBC held a hackathon, in observance of Open Data Day. Sean Whalley wrote up a fabulous review [here](http://peidevs.github.io/OpenDataBookClub/2016/03/05/Open-Data-Day). Also, Dustin Sparks was interviewed by the [CBC.](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/data-computer-apps-open-government-1.3478962)
* Hackathons require a lot of planning/energy, and so the March [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-PEI/events/229432782/) was simply a review for those who couldn't attend.

### April, May

* Some members of ODBC traveled to _The Port City_, Saint John, NB for the Canadian Open Data Summit 2016. Our own Michael Easter joined Catherine McGovern and Richard Pietro for a [lightning talk](https://youtu.be/5DiBSloGRl0?t=3h15m37s) on the Open Data Book Club concept.
* Due to the conference, there was no meetup in April; the May [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-PEI/events/230810502/) featured a recap by Evan Porter and Michael Easter.

### June

* Arguably the most significant event of the year, the June [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-PEI/events/231888459/) featured Carol Mayne, Director of Business Application Services (in Finance and ITSS), with the Gov't of PEI, unveiled new [data sets](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/search/site/?f[0]=type:service&f[1]=field_service_topics:2237) as part of the [Open Government License](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/finance/open-government-licence-prince-edward-island).
* This work was influenced, in part, by the [Directors' Forum](http://peidevs.github.io/OpenDataBookClub/2016/01/21/news-for-JAN-2016) in Dec 2015, which featured presentations by Peter Rukavina and many members of the ODBC.
* Some CBC articles are [here](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-open-data-1.3634672) and [here.](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-open-data-portal-1.3637303)
* Our ODBC members have been experimenting with various visualizations of this data [here.](https://github.com/peidevs/OpenDataBookClub/blob/master/doc/LocalResources.md)

### September

* July and August meetups consisted of summer socials, but the September [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-PEI/events/233915223/) featured Paul Alan, Director of Communications at Elections PEI. Paul presented on the plebiscite on Electoral Reform. We had hoped for a strong turnout, but suspect that we were too early in the calendar for this issue. Thankfully, the small group rallied with excellent questions.

### October

* The October [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-PEI/events/234804726/) was hosted by Robertson Library at the University of Prince Edward Island, as part of International Open Access Week. The evening featured two presentations: _The Value of Open Data in Climate Research" by Dr. Adam Fenech and _Health Data in an Open Data World_ by Mary-Ann MacSwain.

### November

* Finally, the November [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-PEI/events/235416807/) featured _elder-emeritus_ Bob Shand speaking on Civic Address Data. Terry Scott and Steve Dickie were on-hand as blue-shirts, representing the province. The evening represented the essence of the ODBC idea: with gov't reps and engaged citizens getting face-time on a specific data set. 

### Recap

A busy year, for sure! This recap does not cover various evangelical efforts in the form of informal meetings/lunches, planning, and so on to try and explain the _Open Data_ concept to various people & agencies across PEI. 

Many thanks to the ODBC members for their support, whether it is via attending meetups/hackathons, contributing to GitHub or Slack, or even RTs on social media. You have made a difference.

The schedule for early 2017 is unclear, with a major exception: PEI Devs and ODBC are planning another hackathon for Open Data Day on March 4, 2017. Save the date!
