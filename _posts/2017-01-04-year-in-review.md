## 2016 In Review

Happy New Year! Here are some links to various meetups, talks, and other online artifacts from 2016.

* At the January [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-PEI/events/227801712/), Michael Easter spoke on [PDF Box](https://pdfbox.apache.org/).
* Also in January, [CBC Maritime Noon](http://www.cbc.ca/maritimenoon/2016/01/13/a-parking-warning-your-immigration-feedback-maritime-directions/) interviewed ODBC on [PEI Landmarks](http://peidevs.github.io/OpenDataBookClub/landmarks/landmarks.html). (This is a light-hearted interview about landmarks, not Open Data per se.)
* At the February [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-PEI/events/228548487/), Robert Hughes, CAO with the Town of Stratford provided an overview of the services provided by the Town, and an initiative on Open Data and Open Government. 
* Also in February, [Michael Easter](http://twitter.com/30_for_60) spoke at a CIPS PEI Luncheon on 'Open Data and Generation Open'. Several OBBC members attended as well. Web-viewable presentation [here](http://peidevs.github.io/OpenDataBookClub/presentations/2016_FEB_18_CIPS_PEI) and PDF [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/og83kzxl1z08v55/2016_FEB_18_CIPS_PEI.pdf?dl=0)
