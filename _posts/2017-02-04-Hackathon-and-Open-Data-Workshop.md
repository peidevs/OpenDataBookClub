Please join us on Saturday March 4th for the annual Hackathon hosted by PEI Developers and the Open Data Book Club. Come out and celebrate International Open Data Day. Teams will be exploring ideas and building out proof of concepts throughout the day.
Dont Feel like you have the technical skills to attend a hackathon? That's no problem, teams will consist of all interests and skill levels. No technical skills are required and all are welcome. Interested in just talking about open data and not building out an application? Breakout sessions will be held through the day for those interested in various topics.
