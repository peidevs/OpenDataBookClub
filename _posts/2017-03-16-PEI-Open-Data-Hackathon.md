## Introduction

March 4, 2017, was [International Open Data Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Open_Data_Day), a day intended to promote Open Data [across Canada](http://codeacross.ca/) and [around the globe](http://opendataday.org) through various hackathons, seminars, and presentations.

Here on PEI, organizers from [PEI Devs](http://www.meetup.com/PEI-Developers/) and the [Open Data Book Club](http://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-PEI) teamed up to hold the [PEI Open Data Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/march-4th-2017-hackathon-and-open-data-workshop-tickets-31777310792#) at the [Startup Zone](https://startupzone.ca/) in Charlottetown.

## Team Presentations

Below is a recap of efforts by the various teams.

### Federal Data Explorers 

This team of intrepid data explorers searched through the federal Open Data portal, finding narratives pertaining to [museum/heritage inventory](https://twitter.com/roflcopter1101/status/838048748651544576), electoral results, [motor vehicles](https://twitter.com/Jodilynne3/status/838142725769805824), [DUI stats](https://twitter.com/Jodilynne3/status/838136877437894656) and immigration.

The end-result was an increased awareness of data-sets and interaction on [social media](https://twitter.com/roflcopter1101/status/838048748651544576) with kindred spirits in Ottawa.

### Emergency Room Scheduler

The pitch: imagine an app that compares distance and current wait-times of PEI Emergency Rooms, so that the user can make an informed decision about which one to choose.  

The team wrote a prototype web application that scraped data from a gov't web page (below), and provides [comparison graphs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/100794919@N05/33136149251/in/dateposted/) to the user.

### Space Battle

Our event was not restricted to _Open Data_ projects: folks were invited to simply come and hack on a project as well. In that spirit, Team Space Battle wrote a game that must be seen to be believed. The image of the villain ultimately comes from a _webcam on laptop_. That's right: the game-play is to _shoot lasers at your friend_ ! This explains the [maniacal laughter and cheer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/100794919@N05/33136140771/in/dateposted/) that came from their table.
