### Brainstorm Doc

* This doc is intended to spark ideas about data requests for Elections PEI.
    * They are spooling up in the Open Data spirit.
    * They are working on a new website and investigating an Open Data license.
    * Regarding data sets, they would like to priortize their efforts and are asking the public (us!) for input.
* To the end of identifying data sets of interest, there are links below:
    * existing PDF data on Elections PEI
    * examples of Open Data in other provinces
    * Elections BC is an excellent [example](http://elections.bc.ca/resources/statistics/):
        * data is freely available
        * machine-readable (not PDF!)
        * explicitly licensed [link](http://elections.bc.ca/docs/EBC-Open-Data-Licence.pdf)
* An alternative to requesting a specific data set is to consider a category:
    * election results
    * financial data (e.g. political contributions)
    * mapping data
