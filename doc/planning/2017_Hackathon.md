###Date 
Saturday March 4th, 2017

###Time
8am-8pm

###Location
Startup Zone

###Who
We want everyone to attend. Not just tech focus. We want to include librarians, Business, designers, people new to software, students.
As much as we want to build software and play with tech we also want to focus on the discussion of open data.

###Theme
In coordination with the international Open Data Day. The hackathon will be exploring open data in PEI.

###Ideas and Resources
* Discover your family history ([Family Search](https://familysearch.org/indexing/)) ([World Record Recap](https://familysearch.org/blog/en/worldsrecordsrecap/))
* PEI Open Data Portal [Link](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/search/site/?f%5B0%5D=type%3Aservice&f%5B1%5D=field_service_topics%3A2237)
* 511 Data [Link](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/service/view-pei-511-road-conditions)
* GIS Data Portal [Link](http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/)
* Wind Energy [Link](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/service/view-peis-wind-energy-generation)
* Assuming the Province has an official Open Data Portal (e.g. CKAN), explore the API.
* NB has an [Open Data Viz Challenge](http://huddle.today/nbsprn-to-host-open-data-visualization-challenge/) that encourages work prior to the event. (Submitted entries [are here](http://www.govmakerconference.ca/vote/)). The event itself is a show-and-tell. This solves the problems of (a) environment setup (b) time pressure that plagues hackathons. 
* Define a specific problem/dataset and concentrate on that for the day. Suggestions:
    * Refine the [PEI Landmarks](http://peidevs.github.io/OpenDataBookClub/landmarks/landmarks.html) project. This project is by no means complete.
    * Refine [PDF Thresher](https://github.com/peidevs/OpenDataBookClub/tree/master/tools/PDF_Thresher) so that journalists/others can use it as a standalone binary/website. This would be a tremendous service to the community.
    * Target a suite of PDF files and liberate the data.
* Sports Data [Link](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/) Provided courtesy of [Brad Barkhouse](https://twitter.com/mysportsfeeds) of Binary Star
* [PEI Levee Data](https://github.com/reinvented/levees) maintained by Peter Rukavina ([@ruk](https://twitter.com/ruk))
* Note that some ODBC members want to participate (in general) but are not coders. A nice-to-have for this specific event is to find a way to include them.
