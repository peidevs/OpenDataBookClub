* NB has an [Open Data Viz Challenge](http://huddle.today/nbsprn-to-host-open-data-visualization-challenge/) that encourages work prior to the event. (Submitted entries [are here](http://www.govmakerconference.ca/vote/)). The event itself is a show-and-tell. This solves the problems of (a) environment setup (b) time pressure that plagues hackathons. 
* Define a specific problem/dataset and concentrate on that for the day. Suggestions:
    * Refine the [PEI Landmarks](http://peidevs.github.io/OpenDataBookClub/landmarks/landmarks.html) project. This project is by no means complete.
    * Refine [PDF Thresher](https://github.com/peidevs/OpenDataBookClub/tree/master/tools/PDF_Thresher) so that journalists/others can use it as a standalone binary/website. This would be a tremendous service to the community.
    * Target a suite of PDF files and liberate the data.
